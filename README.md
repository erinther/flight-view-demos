# Flight View Demos

Various (that's the plan, at least) experiments of combining FlightJS with View
components of other frameworks.

## Status

- Ember + Flight: Probably a pretty bad idea. Ember has a nice modular
  architecture, but you still can't just use Ember Views with 2-way-data binding
  out of the box without using the Router. Also, porting it to a different
  template engine would be hard.

- Knockout + Flight: This is great. Combined with ES5 getters and setters it
  feels like magic and requires super little setup code. There's also support
  for callbacks in loops so you can add animations. Without that it's nearly
  impossible to animate the removal of a node.

- Rivets + Flight: Wonderful experience. Comes with ES5 magic out of the box and
  just works. However, I wonder if there's a way to use transitions for loops
  and showing/hiding elements.
